# Change the Context Menu in Windows 11 to the same context menu we are used to in Windows 10:

We could do this manually by creating keys and assigning some values using regEdt, but I believe this is was easier to use.

## How to use?
1. Download the file named ```Allow-Extended-Context-Menu-on-Right-Click-Windows-11.reg```
2. Right click the file and choose Merge, if you are asked for admin permissions, click "Yes".


If you don't see the ```Merge``` option when right-clicking the file, try pressing ```Shift + Right click```


I hope you find this helpful.
